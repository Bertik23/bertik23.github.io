A few days ago the first release of [Wocabee Bot](https://bit.ly/3ffStcd) came out. But what is this Wocabee Bot all about?

It is a bot that does packs on [Wocabee](wocabee.app) for you. I made it in colaboration with [vladantrhlik](vladantrhlik.github.io) because we were bored of quarantine and doing Wocabee packs is really boaring and tedious.

But to the release. It is a beta, it was flawless on my end, yeah there are some bugs, but we didn't inted to fix them in that release, so I sent it to vladan and he issued to me that it isn't working. Than he installed a pythno package an it run sortoff, so I decided to make it a beta. You can try it. I have run it on Opera and it worked as intended.

And btw. this is my first post, hope to make some more.
