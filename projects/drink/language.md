You can have two cases one - the language is defined, and two - the language is not defined
### Same for both
1. Go to the Drink! folder
1. Open **language.txt**
1. Look if there is a line where the first word is your language

### Is defined
1. Change the first line to the language you want.

### Is not defined
1. Go to the end of the file
1. Add a new line
1. Write `your language|title of the pop up window|text of the pop up window` eg. You want english so you write `english|Drink!|You must drink now!`
1. Go to the sounds folder.
1. Add a _wav_ file with the name of your language eg. _english.wav_ - that is the sound that is played when you must drink.
