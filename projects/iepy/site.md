IEpy is a module that has a list of events that happened. It was inspired by Internet Explorer twitter accounts, IE is famously slow, and they tweet what happened with a delay. I decided to take this idea up a level and made not only this module. But also a Twitter bot that tweets the events. That means that all the data in descriptions is made to be tweeted. I try to make these descriptions funny. But it's a opensource project, so who knows.

The module suppors multiple languages, the only supported languages by me are czech and english. I run my [bot](https://twitter.com/CeskyIE) in czech.
